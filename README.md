Getting your bearings with GLSL can be a bit of a rodeo when you're first getting started. Uğur's 2D tuts were a huge help to me when I was first getting started, and they often show examples that are a little more granular than The Book of Shaders. 

Hopefully this set of examples will help you get started and get your gl bearings here in Touch.

When possible, I've copied the examples as faithfully as possible. What that means is that there may be better ways to approach some challenges - but what you'll find here is as close to the original tutorial as I can manage.
